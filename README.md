# BlackJack Game

This is a simple text-based BlackJack game built in Python.

## Description

The BlackJack game allows users to play a simplified version of the classic casino card game. The player and dealer each receive cards, and the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The game simulates the basic rules of BlackJack, such as dealing cards, handling aces, and allowing the player to either "hit" or "stay."

## Features

- Player vs Dealer gameplay
- Handling of face cards (J, Q, K) and aces (A)
- Simple console interface
- Option for the player to hit or stay
- Dealer must stay if their hand reaches 17 or higher
- If the player goes over 21, they lose
- If the dealer goes over 21, the player wins

## Installation

To run the game, simply clone the repository and run the `Black_Jack.py` script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dipenpan/BlackJack.git
